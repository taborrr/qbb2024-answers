### Exercise 3

#### Step 3.1
• **What do each of these values mean, based on the descriptions of what is being labeled?**
The nuclear nascent RNA signal reflects current RNA production rates for each cell, while the nuclear PCNA signal signifies cell-cycle activity and DNA replication status. The log2 ratio of nRNA/PCNA compares transcription relative to replication activity, which allows us to quantitatively see how RNA production scales with the cell cycle.

#### Step 3.2
• **Look at the knocked-down gene with the highest ratio and the one with the lowest ratio. Look up what their functions are and explain if you think this result makes sense.**
